Collapse Inline Photos
======================

A quick and dirty userscript to revert the recent changes to Twitter that shows photos in tweets inline by default.

I expect Twitter to introduce a setting to disable them soon, but until then install this script and they'll disappear. Too easy!

Installing
----------

- Install your userscript plugin for your favourite modern browser
- Download and install this script
- Browse Twitter!
