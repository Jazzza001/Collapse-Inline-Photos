Collapse Inline Photos
======================

A quick and dirty userscript to revert the recent changes to Twitter that shows photos in tweets inline by default. I expect Twitter to introduce a setting to disable them soon, but until then install this script and they'll disappear. Too easy!

How does it work? This script inserts some CSS that hides inline photos for tweets closed tweets, but shows it for tweets that are open. The only JS is inserting the CSS!

Installing (Chrome)
---------------------

- Install the Tampermonkey extension
- Download the script
- Follow [the manual installation instructions](http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q102)
- Browse Twitter!

Installing (Firefox)
--------------------

- Install the Greasemonkey extension
- Download the script
- Open the script with Firefox, prompting you to install it with Greasemonkey
- Browse Twitter!
